    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Summary (Plain English)</h2>
      <p>We respect your privacy and have designed Drywall Calculator to collect as little data as possible. Here's the short version:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Your calculations are private.</strong> All calculator inputs and results are processed entirely in your web browser. Your room dimensions, project details, and calculation results are never sent to our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>No account required.</strong> You don't need to sign up, log in, or provide any personal information to use the calculator.</li>
        <li><strong>Nothing is stored.</strong> We don't save your calculations, project data, or any information you enter into the calculator.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimal tracking.</strong> We collect only basic anonymous analytics to understand how people use the site.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Read the full policy below for complete details.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Information We Don't Collect</h2>
      <p>Drywall Calculator is designed with privacy in mind. We explicitly do not collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Calculator inputs:</strong> Your room dimensions, measurements, material selections, and other values you enter into the calculator are never transmitted to our servers. All calculations happen locally in your browser using JavaScript.</li>
        <li><strong>Calculation results:</strong> The sheets needed, costs, material quantities, and other outputs are computed on your device and are not sent to us.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal project information:</strong> We don't know what project you're working on, where it's located, or any details about your home or property.</li>
        <li><strong>Account data:</strong> There are no user accounts, so we don't collect usernames, passwords, or profile information.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial information:</strong> We don't process payments or collect credit card, bank, or other financial details.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you close the browser tab, your calculator session is gone. We have no record of it.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Information That May Be Collected</h2>
      <p>While the calculator itself doesn't collect data, some information may be collected through standard web technologies:</p>

      <h3>Analytics</h3>
      <p>We may use analytics services to understand how visitors use our website. This helps us improve the calculator and identify technical issues. Analytics data is anonymous and aggregated, meaning we cannot identify individual users. Typical analytics data includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pages visited and time spent on site</li>
        <li>General geographic region (country or city level, not precise location)</li>
        <li>Device type (desktop, mobile, tablet)</li>
        <li>Browser and operating system</li>
        <li>Referral source (how you found our site)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This data helps us understand which calculator tabs are most popular, whether pages load properly on different devices, and where our visitors come from.</p>

      <h3>Server Logs</h3>
      <p>Like most websites, our hosting provider automatically collects basic server logs when you visit. These logs may include your IP address, browser type, and pages requested. Server logs are used for security monitoring and troubleshooting and are typically deleted automatically after a short retention period.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Email Contact Data</h2>
      <p>If you choose to contact us via email, the information you include in your message (name, email address, message content) is received directly in our email inbox.</p>
      <p>We use this information solely to respond to your inquiry. We do not add you to marketing lists, sell your contact information, or share it with third parties for promotional purposes. If you request deletion of your contact data, we will remove any messages we have stored.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Drywall Calculator uses the following third-party services:</p>

      <h3>Vercel</h3>
      <p>Our website is hosted on Vercel's platform. Vercel may collect standard server logs and performance metrics. Visit <a href="https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy</a> for their privacy practices.</p>

      <h3>Analytics</h3>
      <p>If we implement analytics tracking, it will be noted here along with opt-out instructions. Currently, we aim to minimize tracking and use privacy-respecting analytics options where possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>Cookies are small text files stored on your device by websites you visit.</p>
      <p><strong>Essential cookies:</strong> We may use essential cookies required for basic website functionality. These do not track you across sites or collect personal information.</p>
      <p><strong>Analytics cookies:</strong> If we use analytics services, they may set cookies to distinguish unique visitors and track sessions. These cookies contain anonymous identifiers, not personal information.</p>
      <p><strong>Third-party cookies:</strong> Third-party services we use (such as analytics providers) may set their own cookies according to their privacy policies.</p>
      <p>You can control cookies through your browser settings. Most browsers allow you to block or delete cookies. Note that blocking essential cookies may affect website functionality.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>You have the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request information about what data we have about you (for most visitors, this is nothing beyond analytics aggregates).</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Request deletion of any contact form messages you've sent us.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> Use browser settings or extensions to block analytics tracking and cookies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@drywallcalculator.net">info@drywallcalculator.net</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Drywall Calculator is a general-purpose tool not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information through the contact form, please contact us and we will delete it promptly.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.</p>
      <p>We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Continued use of the website after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
