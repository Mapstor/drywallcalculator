      <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>The calculations and estimates provided by Drywall Calculator are for <strong>informational and planning purposes only</strong>. This service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied.</p>
      <p>Specifically, we do not warrant that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Calculator results will be accurate, complete, or suitable for your specific project</li>

        <li>The service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free</li>
        <li>Results obtained from using the service will be reliable</li>

    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Drywall Calculator and its operators shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from:</p>

      <p>You expressly understand and agree that you use this service at your sole risk. The calculator provides estimates only; actual material requirements depend on factors including room complexity, installer skill, material waste, and local conditions that cannot be predicted by any calculator.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Accuracy</h2>
      <p>We strive to provide accurate calculations based on established formulas and industry-standard coverage rates. Our methodology is documented on the <a href="/about/">About page</a>. However, we do not guarantee the accuracy of any results.</p>
      <p>Factors that may cause actual requirements to differ from estimates include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Room shapes and architectural features not captured by simple measurements</li>
        <li>Varying waste rates based on installer experience</li>
        <li>Material variations between manufacturers</li>
        <li>Regional differences in pricing and product availability</li>
        <li>Changes in material costs over time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Always verify calculations independently and purchase materials with appropriate contingency for your project's complexity.</p>
    </section>
