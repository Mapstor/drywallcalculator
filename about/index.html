    <h1>About Drywall Calculator</h1>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>What This Calculator Does</h2>
      <p>Drywall Calculator is a free online tool designed to help homeowners, DIY enthusiasts, and contractors estimate the materials needed for drywall installation projects. Instead of guessing quantities or making multiple trips to the hardware store, you can calculate precise material requirements before you begin.</p>

      <p>The calculator includes five specialized tabs, each addressing a different aspect of drywall material estimation:</p>

      <p><strong>Sheets Calculator:</strong> The primary calculator determines how many drywall sheets you need based on your room dimensions. Enter the length, width, and ceiling height of your space, specify whether you're covering walls, ceilings, or both, and account for doors, windows, and other openings. The calculator supports three standard sheet sizes (4'×8', 4'×10', and 4'×12') and includes an adjustable waste factor to account for cuts, mistakes, and irregular layouts.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost Estimator:</strong> This tab helps you budget for your project by estimating material costs based on current national averages. You can toggle between DIY (materials only) and professional installation, and select from four finish levels ranging from basic Level 0-2 through premium Level 5. The estimator provides a cost range rather than a single number, reflecting real-world price variation between regions and suppliers.</p>

      <p><strong>Joint Compound (Mud) Calculator:</strong> Calculates how much joint compound you'll need for taping and finishing. Choose between all-purpose, topping, or setting compound types, and specify the number of coats you plan to apply (typically three for standard finishing). The calculator outputs both total gallons needed and a practical shopping list showing 5-gallon bucket quantities.</p>

      <p><strong>Screws Calculator:</strong> Determines the number of drywall screws required based on your square footage and stud spacing. The calculator accounts for the different screw densities needed for 16-inch versus 24-inch on-center framing, and converts the total into pounds and 5-pound box quantities for easy purchasing.</p>

      <p><strong>Tape Calculator:</strong> Estimates the linear feet of paper tape needed for your project, with an option to include corner tape. The calculator factors in both flat seams and, when selected, vertical corners and ceiling perimeter tape requirements.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>The Science Behind the Calculations</h2>
      <p>Our calculations are based on standard construction industry formulas and material coverage rates that have been established through decades of professional drywall installation practice. These standards are maintained by organizations like the <a href="https://www.gypsum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gypsum Association</a> and codified in <a href="https://www.iccsafe.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICC building codes</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Area calculations</strong> follow basic geometry. Wall area equals the room perimeter (2 × length + 2 × width) multiplied by ceiling height. Ceiling area equals length times width. Openings are subtracted using standard estimates: 21 square feet per door and 15 square feet per window, which represent typical residential door and window sizes.</p>

      <p><strong>Sheet quantity</strong> is calculated by dividing the total area (plus waste factor) by the square footage of your selected sheet size. The result is rounded up because you cannot purchase partial sheets. The waste factor, adjustable from 5% to 20%, accounts for the material lost to cuts around outlets, corners, and windows, as well as damaged pieces and fitting requirements.</p>

      <p><strong>Joint compound coverage</strong> is based on industry-standard application rates. All-purpose compound covers approximately 20 square feet per gallon per coat. Topping compound, being applied in thinner layers, covers roughly 33 square feet per gallon. Setting compound falls between these at approximately 25 square feet per gallon. These rates assume standard taping and finishing techniques on flat surfaces.</p>

      <p><strong>Screw density</strong> follows building code requirements for proper drywall fastening. With 16-inch on-center stud spacing, approximately 28-32 screws are needed per 4'×8' sheet (roughly 1 screw per square foot). With 24-inch spacing, fewer studs means fewer screws needed—approximately 0.75 screws per square foot. These calculations assume standard 8-inch screw spacing along edges and 12-inch spacing in the field.</p>

      <p><strong>Tape requirements</strong> are estimated at 0.3 linear feet per square foot of drywall for flat seams. This ratio accounts for the typical pattern of horizontal and vertical joints in a standard installation. Corner tape, when included, adds the ceiling perimeter plus vertical corner lengths.</p>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Who This Calculator Is For</h2>
      <p>This calculator serves anyone planning a drywall project, from first-time DIYers to experienced professionals:</p>

      <p><strong>Homeowners and DIY enthusiasts</strong> can use the calculator to plan renovation projects, estimate costs before committing to a project, and create accurate shopping lists. Understanding material quantities upfront helps avoid costly mid-project supply runs and ensures you purchase adequate materials without excessive waste.</p>

      <p><strong>Contractors and tradespeople</strong> can quickly generate material estimates for client quotes and job planning. While experienced professionals often estimate by eye, the calculator provides a useful double-check and documentation for project records.</p>

      <p><strong>Property managers and landlords</strong> can estimate repair and renovation costs when planning maintenance work or evaluating contractor bids.</p>

      <p><strong>Real estate investors</strong> can use the cost estimator to factor drywall work into renovation budgets when analyzing potential property purchases.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Our Methodology</h2>
      <p>The formulas in this calculator reflect widely accepted practices in the drywall and construction industry. Material coverage rates are derived from manufacturer specifications and professional installation guidelines published by the <a href="https://www.gypsum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gypsum Association</a> and major drywall manufacturers including <a href="https://www.usg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USG</a>, <a href="https://www.nationalgypsum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Gypsum</a>, and <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CertainTeed</a>.</p>

      <p>Cost estimates are based on national average prices for materials and labor, updated to reflect current market conditions. Labor rates vary significantly by region, so the calculator provides ranges rather than fixed values. Professional installation costs account for different finish levels as defined by the <a href="https://www.gypsum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gypsum Association's GA-214 standard</a> (Levels 0-5), with higher levels requiring more joint compound, additional sanding, and greater skill.</p>

      <p>The waste factor recommendation of 10% represents a reasonable middle ground for typical residential rooms. Simple rectangular rooms with few openings may only need 5-7% waste allowance, while complex layouts with multiple corners, angles, and cutouts may require 15-20% or more.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Limitations and Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>This calculator provides estimates intended for planning purposes only. Actual material requirements may vary based on factors not captured by our calculations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Room complexity:</strong> Irregular shapes, cathedral ceilings, soffits, and architectural features require more cutting and generate more waste than simple rectangular rooms.</li>
        <li><strong>Installer experience:</strong> Experienced installers typically produce less waste than beginners. The waste factor should be adjusted accordingly.</li>
        <li><strong>Material quality:</strong> Damaged materials from shipping or handling may need replacement. Inspect all materials before installation.</li>
        <li><strong>Local conditions:</strong> Prices vary significantly by region, season, and supplier. Our cost estimates reflect national averages and may not match your local market.</li>
        <li><strong>Building codes:</strong> Some applications (fire-rated assemblies, moisture-prone areas) require specific drywall types not addressed by this calculator.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>This calculator is not a substitute for professional advice.</strong> For complex projects, structural modifications, fire-rated assemblies, or commercial construction, consult with a licensed contractor or building professional. Always verify local building code requirements before beginning work.</p>

      <p>Cost estimates should be verified with local suppliers before budgeting. Get multiple quotes for professional installation work.</p>
